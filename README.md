# Tic Tac Toe
This project is the third one in Ruby module at Microverse. In this project, we built a Tic Tac Toe game

## Getting Started

In this project, we built a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.
In this game, you will play against AI a game with 3 X 3 grid. The player who has
consecutive positions (o or X) wins. If all the positions are filled and we don't have a winning move, we'll have a draw.
